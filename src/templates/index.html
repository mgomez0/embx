<h5>Who am I?</h5>
<p>I'm an embedded software engineer that's worked at companies like Apple, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Sonos.
    I've worked on everything from bare-metal microcontrollers for low-power home security applications, to RTOS-based
    power monitoring on an ARM SoC
    (Apple Silicon), to userspace embedded Linux applications (Sonos audio distribution). No matter where I worked,
    I was universally disappointed by the state of embedded developer experience. A lack of cohesion around fast
    and easy testing, reproducible builds, and modern tooling is a giant anchor on the domain as a whole. I want to
    lift that anchor.
