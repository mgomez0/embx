    <h3>day 1</h3>
    <h4>1/26/2024</h4>
    <p>I've done some introductory market research into the current state of modernizing the embedded
        development experience, and it leaves so much wanting. There are several notable roadblocks to making
        changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vendor lock is a serious problem. proprietary tools restricted and licensed by chipmakers inevitably
            fall behind the quality of opensource parallels.</li>
        <li>Embedded developers are notoriously resistant to change, scoffing at QoL improvements as passing
            fads. Some of them are. But this mentality limits more than it protects, in my opinion.</li>
        <li>The embedded development community is relatively small, fragmented, and "offline" - in comparison to
            our web/mobile/SaaS counterparts. The fact is that as the demand for pure software application
            development increases, pay will skew towards those jobs and skillsets, so less developers will enter
            the embedded workforce. Less young blood, less innovation, more comfortable greybeards writing C in
            notepad++.
            It's a chicken-and-egg problem - embedded development requires patience, a willingness to overlook
            ergonomics for the sake of getting things done. Many try it, and leave for a higher paycheck which
            requires far less initial effort.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are some companies that seem to be leading the charge in this space</p>
    <ul>
        <li>memfault</li>
        <p>very interesting platform that emphasizes observability for IoT fleets. I gave it a cursory
            whirl - the UI is sleek, with lots of options. Administering a fleet of internet-connected
            devices through this UI looks like a pleasurable experience, and could deliver a ton of
            value to both
            technical and non-technical staff. They seem to have a pretty solid engineering staff and
            their blog is topnotch. Maybe I'll go work for them if this whole thing falls apart.</p>
        <li>dojofive(?)</li>
        <p> This is a small company based out of St. Paul, Minnesota, that purports to offer a similar
            modernization of development practices, but in the form of a full-blown consultancy. I'm not
            sure this is the way to do it right off the bat - I'd rather dive deep into exactly one
            thing and
            do that one thing extremely well. </p>
        <li>????</li>
        <p>There's a host of opensource frameworks like zephyr and platformio that are trying to move things in
            the right direction - but even these platforms are slow to be adopted.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>My goal is to evaluate the most popular chip architectures with a series of increasingly complex rust
        projects until I settle on something worth pursuing to fabrication. Along the way, I plan to document my
        findings,
        and bring modern software development practices as much as possible - Docker to isolate dependencies and
        provide an easily distributable development environment, (my flavor of) test-driven development, CI/CD,
        source control. If, along the way, I identify a gap in Rust support that requires opensource
        contribution,
        I'd be thrilled to attempt to fill that gap as a method of gaining credibility in the community and
        contributing back to a language that genuinely think is the future of all systems computing </p>

    <p>Even if I don't get rich, at least I learned something new.</p>
