    <h3>evaluation plan</h3>
    <h4>1/27/2024</h4>
    <p>I'm looking at a few different platforms to evalute Rust's capabilities</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Raspberry Pi 3</li>
        <li>Raspberry Pi Pico W</li>
        <li>nRF</li>
        <li>ESP32</li>
        <li>STM32</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm interested in evaluating a few layers of abstraction - bare-metal, RTIC, and Embassy. I'm
        particularly interested in audio processing and distribution, as it relates to my day job, so maybe a
        cheap mic and some speakers would make for good peripherals.</p>
