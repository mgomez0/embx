<h3>how did I build this blog?</h3>
<h4>2/4/2024</h4>
<p>Deplyoment turned out to be an utter joy using Docker
    and fly.io. Highly recommend this stack for containerized apps;
    even for an embedded guy like me, getting on the web was a piece
    of cake. I copy-pasted a dead simple Dockerfile for building
    a Rust app from somewhere on Stack Overflow, tested the image/container locally,
    then fly.io and their CLI
    tool flyctl ingested the contents of the Dockerfile and automatically
    configured the deployment. Insanely smooth experience - my deployment
    didn't require postgres or redis, but I imagine if your application includes those
    dependencies it would still be super easy. Configuring continuous deployment via
    Github Actions was a breeze. The fly.io documentation is pretty good, but the
    maintainers acknowledge a few details might be out of date - in <code>fly.yml</code>,
    <code>actions/checkout@v3</code> should be
    <code>actions/checkout@v4</code>. I was also a bit confused by the process of generating
    security certificates so I could use my own domain, but once I figured out I actually needed to
    enter that flow, it was painless. I picked up the domain on Squarespace,
    pointed an A record at the fly.io hosted IP, and just like that, my Rust app was live.
