    <p>After getting the picoprobe set up, I was able to flash the blinky example to my Pico W. Keep in mind the Pico W
    onboard LED is no longer connected - I picked a different GPIO and wired a LED and resistor in series to it.  Blinky is
    always a satisfying place to start.

    <p>I had a pleasant experience getting up and running with my Pico W. Since I'm doing
    all my development on a M2 MacBook Air, I decided to pursue the picoprobe configuration, where one
    Pico is actually used to flash and debug the other. The fantastic <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/">documentation</a>
     addresses this in detail ("Getting Started With Raspberry Pi Pico", Appendix A), so I won't rehash that writing.
